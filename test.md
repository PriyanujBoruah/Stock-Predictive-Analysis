# Cheap Eats: Burgers & Momos\n\nA simple website showcasing a burger and momo restaurant menu, with a contact form.\n\n## Features\n\n*   **User-friendly interface:**  Easy navigation through the menu sections and contact form.\n*   **Clear presentation:**  Visually appealing design with clear information on the menu items and pricing.\n*   **Contact form:** Allows customers to easily reach out to the restaurant.\n*   **Smooth scrolling:**  Effortless navigation between different sections of the website.\n*   **Basic form validation:** Ensures essential fields (name and email) are filled out before submission.\n\n\n## Technologies Used\n\n*   HTML5\n*   CSS3\n*   JavaScript\n\n## Getting Started\n\nTo run this project locally:\n\n1.  **Clone the repository:**\n    ```bash\n    git clone \u003crepository-url\u003e\n    ```\n\n2.  **Open the `index.html` file** in your web browser.  You'll need to have the `hero-image.jpg` image in the same directory as the `index.html` file.\n\n\n## Directory Structure\n\n```\nCheapEats/\n├── index.html\n├── style.css\n├── script.js\n└── hero-image.jpg  // Replace with your hero image\n```\n\n## HTML Structure\n\nThe HTML structure is designed to be well-organized and semantically correct, with clear sectioning for different content:\n\n*   **Hero Section:** Introduces the restaurant with a heading, description, and an image.\n*   **Menu Sections:** Displays burger and momo menus with respective items and prices.\n*   **Testimonials Section:** Showcases customer feedback.\n*   **Contact Section:** Provides a form for customers to contact the restaurant.\n*   **Footer:** Includes copyright information.\n\n## CSS Styling\n\nThe CSS is designed to create a clean and modern look:\n\n*   **Basic Styling:**  Sets the basic font, colors, and layout for the entire website.\n*   **Responsive Design:**  Assumes a responsive design, which is not explicitly tested.\n*   **Form Styling:** Styles the contact form elements for a user-friendly experience.\n\n\n## JavaScript Functionality\n\nThe JavaScript code performs the following tasks:\n\n*   **Smooth Scrolling:**  Handles smooth transitions between sections when a link in the navigation is clicked.\n*   **Form Validation:**  Adds basic form validation to the contact form to ensure that the name and email fields are filled out before submitting.  Critically important for security and maintainability.\n\n## Improvements and Future Considerations\n\n*   **Advanced Form Handling:** Implement AJAX or similar methods to handle form submissions without page reloads. This is a good next step.\n*   **Server-Side Validation:**  For more robust validation and security, server-side validation should be added to prevent malicious input.\n*   **More Comprehensive Validation:**  Validate the format of the email address.\n*   **Error Handling:** Implement a more advanced error handling mechanism for the contact form.\n*   **Image Optimization:** Use optimized image formats (like WebP) to reduce page load times.\n*   **Responsive Design Testing:** Thoroughly test the responsiveness of the design across various screen sizes and devices.\n*   **Accessibility:** Ensure the website is accessible to users with disabilities by following accessibility guidelines (e.g., WCAG).\n\n\n## Contact\n\nFor any questions or issues, please feel free to reach out.  This README file is a great starting point for understanding the project and should serve as a good reference when making changes.\n
