This Streamlit app provides stock price predictions and sentiment analysis using a combination of historical data, advanced time series forecasting with the Prophet model, and real-time news sentiment analysis.  It's designed to offer users a comprehensive view of a stock's potential future performance by combining quantitative analysis with qualitative insights derived from news articles.

## How it Works

This app utilizes several key technologies and methodologies to provide its predictive and analytical capabilities:


1. **Data Acquisition:**
   - Uses the `yfinance` library to fetch historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance.  The user-specifed time period determines the range of data retrieved.

2. **Price Forecasting with Prophet:**
   - The historical stock data is processed and formatted for use with the Prophet forecasting model.
   - Prophet, a robust time series forecasting library developed by Meta, is employed to generate future price predictions.  Prophet excels at handling the complexities of financial time series, including seasonality and trend changes.
   - The model outputs predictions for a specified future period (including the next day and the following week), along with uncertainty bounds.

3. **News Sentiment Analysis:**
   - The app uses the NewsAPI to fetch news articles relevant to the selected company. The company name is resolved using the Google Gemini generative AI model to ensure accurate news retrieval.
   - The Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library, combined with the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) sentiment analyzer, is used to analyze the sentiment expressed in news headlines and descriptions.  VADER assigns a sentiment score to each piece of text, indicating its positivity, negativity, or neutrality.  
   - The sentiment scores from multiple articles are aggregated to provide an overall sentiment trend for the stock.

4. **Visualization and Display:**
   - The Streamlit framework powers the interactive web application.
   - Plotly is used to create dynamic and visually appealing charts that display the historical stock prices, Prophet forecasts, and uncertainty bands.
   - The app presents the predicted next-day price, weekly change forecast, and overall news sentiment score in a clear and concise format.
   - Links to the relevant news articles are provided to allow users to delve deeper into the information driving the sentiment analysis.
